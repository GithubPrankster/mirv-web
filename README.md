# MIRV-Web
*Make Incredibly Rad Vidyas on the Web*

## What is MIRV-Web about??
*MIRV-Web* is a little game engine where you can program neat things, host them, and get friends and folks
to play them. This can be done by making scripts, adding in assets and logic, and voila!

To get started, read the currently nonexistant documentation. Or the source code, perhaps that exists...
## Scripting
There is currently 1 script type, Lua scripting, which utilizes the famous language's C API to insert functions
interacting with the engine and its features. That way, MIRV-Web does the hard work and you do the easy stuff.

In the future, more script types such as C using libtcc may be added. It's an open sauce thing so who knows!
## Assets
Oh, the things to make little jimmy the great move around and talk? Here are the ones currently planned to be
supported:

* [Visual]: .png (lossless), .bmp (lossless), .tga (lossless)
* [Audio]: .opus (lossy), .flac (lossless)

For things such as text, there will be functions to import text files directly to play with. Bring your own format!
